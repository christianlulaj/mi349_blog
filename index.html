      I started playing sports in the seventh grade. The first sport I ever played
      was soccer. I played for my Middle School which was St. Anne. I played striker. 
      The season was 16 games. We went 9-7 and I was the leading goal scorer with 30
      goals. 
     </p>

     <p>
      The next sport I played was IM Basketball. I played this in highschool. 
      I was a small forward. This was definitely not my best sport. I love
      watching basketball, but soccer came easier to me. So all in all basketball
      was harder, but much more enjoyable to me. 
     </p>

     <p>
      Now I am currently retired from organized sports. I just like playing pickup
      sports such as volleyball, soccer, and basketball. I do enjoy
      joining tournaments to play in and playing during vacation. 
      You might be asking yourself the question, will Christian Lulaj ever come 
      out of retirement. The answer to that question is absolutely not. I am only 
      22 years old but my body feels 82.

        <p>
          I started coding seriously at the beginning of 2020. I was very nervous
          to start because everyone around me at college has been coding for a couple
          years and I barely knew what an if statement did. This did not discourage me
          to quit. Instead I went to office hours, read a lot of documentation, I learned
          how to debug, and much more. I got laughed at for silly questions such as 
          when should I use a double for loop or whatever. I am living proof that 
          it doesn't matter when you start as long as you want it bad enough. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The first language I learned was in my CSE 231 class which was Python. 
          Python is a great first language to learn because it will get your feet 
          wet and is not complicated to code in. However, once you master this you 
          should move onto an Object Oriented Programming language such as C++ so 
          that you could learn about how to handle memory and garbage collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still have a long long way to go but I am very excited about my future 
          and learning how to become a much more advanced coder.
