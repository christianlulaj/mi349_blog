                Overview of my Sports Career
              </div>
               <h2> Sports Blogs </h2>
               <p>
                  I started playing sports in the seventh grade. The first sport I ever played
                  was soccer. I played for my Middle School which was St. Anne. I played striker. 
                  The season was 16 games. We went 9-7 and I was the leading goal scorer with 30
                  goals. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  The next sport I played was IM Basketball. I played this in highschool. 
                  I was a small forward. This was definitely not my best sport. I love
                  watching basketball, but soccer came easier to me. So all in all basketball
                  was harder, but much more enjoyable to me. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Now I am currently retired from organized sports. I just like playing pickup
                  sports such as volleyball, soccer, and basketball. I do enjoy
                  joining tournaments to play in and playing during vacation. 
                  You might be asking yourself the question, will Christian Lulaj ever come 
                  out of retirement. The answer to that question is absolutely not. I am only 
                  22 years old but my body feels 82.

              Computer Science Journey

               <h2> Computer Science Career Blog </h2>
              <p>
                I started coding seriously at the beginning of 2020. I was very nervous
                to start because everyone around me at college has been coding for a couple
                years and I barely knew what an if statement did. This did not discourage me
                to quit. Instead I went to office hours, read a lot of documentation, I learned
                how to debug, and much more. I got laughed at for silly questions such as 
                when should I use a double for loop or whatever. I am living proof that 
                it doesn't matter when you start as long as you want it bad enough. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The first language I learned was in my CSE 231 class which was Python. 
                Python is a great first language to learn because it will get your feet 
                wet and is not complicated to code in. However, once you master this you 
                should move onto an Object Oriented Programming language such as C++ so 
                that you could learn about how to handle memory and garbage collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                I still have a long long way to go but I am very excited about my future 
                and learning how to become a much more advanced coder.

      <h2>Tasks of the week (11/01/21 - 11/07/21)</h2>

            <h3>Learn Flexbox and how to use it</h3>
            <p>
               One of my goals this week is to learn how to use flex/flexbox. The way I am approaching this is I will begin by watching
               the lectures provided in MI 349. After that I will go in CodePen and play around with all of the flex properties. A good 
               thing to always do is go and find examples of other people using it online because you could find find a lot of new styles
               and flexes you would have never thought of. The most important part about completing this task is implementing it into 
               this personal blog
            </p>

         <h3>Prepare for my Technical Interview</h3>
            <p>
               I have an interview this Thursday for a company named Epic. The way I am going to prepare for it is grinding out LeetCode problems,
               studying what duties software developers have to do their, and doing my research on the company. I am going to have to go back 
               through my data structures and algorithms notes/code because you are not always going to be working with built-in arrays or lists.
               I am nervous and excited for this opportunity and I hope I make a good impression and get the job.
