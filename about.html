          You are probably wondering who I am. My name is Christian Lulaj. <br> I was 
          born and raised in Michigan. 
          I like to describe myself as a sponge. <br> The reason for this is because 
          you know what sponges do best? 
          They absorb. <br> I love staying in contact with very intellectual people
          that could help me learn or absorb <br> a ton of new information. I 
          am hardworking, and very good at working with people. <br> I am very 
          easy to talk too and a good listener. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of my hobbies are working out, playing basketball, and traveling. 
            I love being <br> outdoors and hanging out with friends. These type of 
            activities do I great job of clearing <br> out your head from all 
            the stresses that come through work, which I will be getting into shortly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a computer science major. I am looking more towards either being a 
            full stack developer <br> or working with security systems. I am keeping
            my options open to other opportunities <br> that my come my way. I was 
            originally going to do accounting until I found out how much I <br>
            love creating things from scratch using software. Now I can't
            wait for my future and see what I can create or help create 
            for this world.
